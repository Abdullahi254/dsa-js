# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Journey

Welcome to your JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey! This repository will guide you through the fundamental concepts and implementations of various data structures and algorithms using JavaScript.

## Introduction

In this journey, you will learn about essential data structures and algorithms that are crucial for software development and problem-solving. Each topic builds upon the previous ones, providing you with a solid foundation in DSA.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the implementations, ensure you have a basic understanding of JavaScript programming concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and objects. Familiarity with data structures like arrays and objects will also be helpful.

### Implementations

1. **Singly Linked List**: Completed.
   - This data structure consists of nodes where each node points to the next one in the sequence.
   - Implementation available in JavaScript.

2. **Doubly Linked List**: In Progress.
   - Doubly linked lists have nodes with pointers to both the next and previous nodes.

3. **Stacks and Queues**: Coming Soon.
   - Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, while queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

4. **Binary Search**: Future Plan.
   - Binary search efficiently finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

5. **Tree Traversal, Binary Heaps, Hash Tables, Graphs, and Graph Traversal**: Future Topics.
   - These topics will cover advanced data structures and algorithms for organizing and manipulating data.

## How to Use

Each implementation will be provided in a separate JavaScript file along with documentation and examples. You can study the code, experiment with it, and use it as a reference for your projects.
